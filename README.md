# How do I run the code?

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080 # or the next free port, check the output
```

# Whats the point?

This is a re-usable sandbox for playing around with the drawing framework `pixi.js`.

# Where to put things?

This repo is meant to be cloned for new projects.

```
/src
  /core
    # Anything re-usable goes here
  /app
    # Anything specific to your project goes here
```

# How to re-use?

 - clone this repo (or copy the code)
 - remove the contents of `/src/app` directory
 - create a new `/app/App.js` file (TBD)
